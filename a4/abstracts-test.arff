"The Dart mouth workshop did not lead to any new breakthroughs, but it did introduce all the major figures to each other. For the next 20 years, the field would be dominated by these people and their students and colleagues at MIT, CMU, Stanford, and IBM. Looking at the proposal for the Dartmouth workshop (McCarthy et al., 1955), we can see why it was necessary for AI to become a separate field. Why couldn’t all the work done in AI have taken place under the name of control theory or operations research or decision theory, which, after all, have objectives similar to those of AI? Or why isn’t AI a branch of mathematics? The first answer is that AI from the start embraced the idea of duplicating human faculties such as creativity, self-improvement, and language use. None of the other fields were addressing these issues. The second answer is methodology. AI is the only one of these fields that is clearly a branch of computer science (although operations research does share an emphasis on computer simulations), and AI is the only field to attempt to build machines that will function autonomously in complex, changing environments.",AI
"The early years of AI were full of successes—in a limited way. Given the primitive comput- ers and programming tools of the time and the fact that only a few years earlier computers were seen as things that could do arithmetic and no more, it was astonishing whenever a com- puter did anything remotely clever. The intellectual establishment, by and large, preferred to believe that “a machine can never do X.” (See Chapter 26 for a long list of X’s gathered by Turing.) AI researchers naturally responded by demonstrating one X after another. John McCarthy referred to this period as the “Look, Ma, no hands!” era. Newell and Simon’s early success was followed up with the General Problem Solver, or GPS. Unlike Logic Theorist, this program was designed from the start to imitate human problem-solving protocols. Within the limited class of puzzles it could handle, it turned out that the order in which the program considered subgoals and possible actions was similar to that in which humans approached the same problems. Thus, GPS was probably the first pro- gram to embody the “thinking humanly” approach. The success of GPS and subsequent pro- grams as models of cognition led Newell and Simon (1976) to formulate the famous physical symbol system hypothesis, which states that “a physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means for general intelligent action.” What they meant is that any system (human or machine) exhibiting intelligence must operate by manipulating data structures composed of symbols. We will see later that this hypothesis has been challenged from many directions.",AI
"Before we get too far with statistics, it’s impor- tant that we develop a common vocabulary about the sorts of things that we measure and count, as well as about how the data that are generated can be organized. In this chapter we will first examine the different sorts of variables encountered in statistics and how they are represented. We will then explore how numerical data are manipulated and inter- preted. Finally, we will describe best practices for data management that will enhance the reliability of your own work and help maintain data access for future users. These practices are an important foun- dation for all students and practitioners of science. Variables can be classified by the sort of infor- mation that is recorded (categories or measure- ments) and also by whether changes in one variable may cause changes in another variable. We discuss each of these situations in the sections below. Variables that include only groups and not measurements are called categorical variables. These are classes of objects into which we can place an individual. Categorical variables can be, in turn, either attributes or ranks. Attributes lack any par- ticular logical order and include such properties as gender (male or female), political affiliation, and whether or not an individual ate a particular food at a picnic. Attributes are also sometimes called nomi- nal variables (names). ",STAT
"Rescaling a graph (such as placing the original values on log scale) is equivalent to doing a log transformation on the original data. If you are not convinced, try doing that with the numbers in ex- ample 2.1; plot [H+] on log scale against log10[H+] on linear scale. Do you get a straight line? There are many biological examples of continu- ous measurements that require log transformation prior to statistical analysis. The sizes of organisms in natural populations often have odd distributions. The bulk of the population is composed of small in- dividuals, but also includes a few individuals that are much larger (and therefore more influential in the population). To adequately analyze such data, it is often necessary to do a log transformation. A good example is plant size, as shown in example 2.3 below. Mathematical transformations are frequently used during statistical analyses in order to correct data for a failure to meet an assumption necessary for the test. You will see more about that topic later in the book (sections 8.4 and 11.4).",STAT
"The Indo-Nepal, sub-commission on water resources was set-up in August 1988, to deal with all aspects of Indo-Nepal Cooperation in the multiple uses of Water Resources for mutual benefit. In additional to the matter already under discussion at secretary-level and other meetings, the sub-commission shall identify new programes/Project for water resources development for cooperation between India and Nepal in specific sectors viz. irrigation, water-logging and drainage, hydro-electric power generation. Inland navigation, collection of hydrological data, measures to prevent and reduce losses due to floods, flood forecasting and flood warning, environment safeguard measures and transfer of technology suited to the requirement of both the countries. The Farkka Barrage Project is designed to subserve the need for preservation and maintenance of the Calcutta Port by improving the regime and navigability of the Bhagirathi- Hooghly River System. The Bhagirathi, the feeder canal and the navigation lock at the Farakka Barrage form part of the Haldi-Allahabad Inland Waterway for which an act has been passed.",ENVS
"The above-mentioned problems created by the dams have led to the opposition in various corners of the country. The experts hold it from time to time that the social, environmental and even economic cost of these dams, however, far outweighs their benefits. The most important social consequence of big dams has been displacement of millions of tribals from their homeland and their eventual influx into urban areas, almost as refugees. This is the reason why Scientists, environmentalists, journalists, social activities, lawyers and bureaucrats have taken up the cry against big dams. The ever-increasing opposition from scientists and environmentalists has forced the Govt. of review a number of proposed dams in the light of their impact on local tribals flora and fauna. Results are also seen. The Govt. had to scrap the Silent Valley Project in Kerala. Likewise, Koel and Karo Project in Bihar was also abandoned due to opposition from local people as it would have displaced several thousands for Santhal tribals in the area.",ENVS
